    <name>Deep Hole</name>
    <description>Looking into the hole reveals two hidden items - pieces if a precious vase that has broken apart. If one desires to acquire items from the world, take would be the perfect action. After an item has been added to your inventory, it can be used on other items or objects by selecting the item you wish to use in the choice box on the left, and the item you wish to use it on in the choice box on the right. To use two items together, one must be dropped in the room while the other must be picked up.</description>

            <description>Try picking up the two vase pieces. To do this, select a vase piece in the choice box on the right, as this contains all items in the current room, and press the take button. There's a trick to using them together, however. As you can only choose one item from your inventory, one of the pieces must be dropped in the room. Then select both vase pieces in the two choice boxes below and press use. </description>
