    <description>What is this? It seems like a combination of some ancient magic and modern technology. It seems to react to human interference, making it light up and buzz slightly.
&lt;br/&gt;
A voice emerges from the device, saying:
&lt;br/&gt;
     "Hello, Dr. Shim. System  analysis reports all systems fully functional. To activate me, press the big, red button, and i will teleport you to your favorite room - let that be our little secret."
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The device is active. Inspect it again to use it.</description>
