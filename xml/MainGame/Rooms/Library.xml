    <description>The library is old and dusty. It’s filled with an endless amount of antique bookshelves, pantings and furniture. In the middle of the room is an old desk with a giant book. Next to the book lies a pair of glasses. The glasses are attached to a chain on the desk. They can’t be removed.</description>
